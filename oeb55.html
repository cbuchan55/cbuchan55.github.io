            <p>"“Amazing class! I really enjoyed this course. Learning about plants helped me better understand both the natural world and myself. Something that stuck with me most in this course is that the growing environments of plants are very important for their development. I was taught to respect natural order (provide proper conditions for growth rather than interference). It was SUPER cool to learn about it. This topic really aligns with my beliefs on developing human virtue with proper care and virtue because I think: “Those who abandon [their seedlings], thinking it will not help are those who do not weed their seedlings. Those who ‘help’ them grow are those who pull on the seedlings. Not only does this not help, but it even harms them” (130; Mengzi 2A2). I also think that the concept of autotrophy (plant’s ability to sustain themselves by photosynthesis) is awesome. I think I can relate this to people’s innate moral potential (the “sprouts of virtue"), and, like plants, can develop autonomously if not interfered with. I would 100% recommend this class, it helps me see the world in a different light!!!" - Mengzi (Mencius) </p>

            <p>"OEB 52 was a relatively fun class! Great professors :) Remember to read over the notes and study hard for the midterm and final exams. Definitely not a gem and hard content, but I learned so many useful things. I really enjoyed learning about symbiosis as it focuses on plants’ interactions with fungi, bacteria, and animals, which highlights the interconnectedness of life. “Heaven and earth were born alongside me, and the ten thousand things and I are one” (234, ZhuangZi), showing that nothing exists in isolation and we are all part of a network that is constantly changing. In addition, the plant's ability to adapt highlights the endless transformation of Dao. The concepts of diversity, adaption, and symbiosis are expressions of Dao’s boundless creativity, which reminds us that life flows together as one. Through the plants, we can see that the Way is not about conquering or controlling, but about coexisting, transforming, and flourishing!!! Overall, the course is graded pretty fairly. If you put in the work, you will be rewarded."

            <p>"Many of my friends enjoyed the class. However, I did not enjoy it as much as they did. There were some topics in the class that I frankly found useless and a waste of time. :( I do not understand why the class teaches about the origins of plants, the evolutionary journey from algae to land plants or interactions with other unimportant species! This is all too theoretical and irrelevant to real world application. When the course shifted towards agriculture, crop growth, and seeds, I thought it was very useful information because agriculture is the foundation of state strength. In my opinion, “the way to organize a country well is, even though the granaries are filled, not to be negligent in agriculture...” (9, Lord Shang “Agriculture and War”). I think that more people should be taught about agriculture in order to better the country. The course could improve by focusing more on teaching students about the aspects of plants that support large-scale farming/agriculture!" - Lord Shang</p>

            <p>"Very fun class, the work is very straight forward. The professors and the TFs were AMAZING. They also brought SNACKS! Plants turn to light due to photosynthesis – so we should also turn toward righteousness. As I always mention: “Once the roots are firmly established, the Way will grow” (Analects 1.2, Confucius). Just as plants must have strong roots in fertile soil to grow (learned in course), people must be firmly grounded in virtue to develop. However, we need to be cautious about the class material because everything is very technical and scientific learning about plants, which can lack a deeper purpose and thinking. A wise word of advice for this course: “If you learn without thinking about what you have learned, you will be lost. If you think without learning, however, you will fall into danger” (Analects 2.15, Confucius)." 
                - Confucius (Kongzi)

            <p> "Definitely a lot more assignments than expected!! Be prepared. Do not think I would recommend this class to other people. Spent a lot of time a week on work. I am particularly skeptical about the topic of biotechnology and transgenics that Professor Kramer and Holbrooke covered in class. I think that these fields hold a lot of potential, but they can be dangerous as they can be used for personal gain. In my opinion, these technological advancements should be governed by principles of impartial care and universal benefit!! That is why, the course could improve by having more discussion about the ethical implications, focusing on cost-benefit for everyone and the greater good. While theoretical study of topics like green algae and plant pattern generation can help us understand the world better, I do not think that there is direct practical application to benefit society. Therefore, I think the professors should maybe reshape the class to teach the students net-benefit material about plants that can immediately help society." - Mozi
