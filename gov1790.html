            <p>"BEWARE, this is NOT a gem and it is NOT easy. You have to put in a lot of work to get an A. Also unlike a lot of other people, I did not particularly enjoy the class as much. I think that the class can improve in many different ways. This class takes too much of an US-centric approach, which limits the understanding of international governance. In my opinion, true learning comes from examining diverse perspectives because “learning must never stop…the gentleman learns broadly and examines himself thrice daily” (270, XunZi). Therefore, we should have more diverse lenses. In addition, even though I value structured institutions, I would say that only having strict discipline and rituals will ensure effectiveness. This is why I think constructivism’s reliance on norms is not enough without enforcement mechanisms. Also I would like to critique economic vulnerabilities and the shortsightedness of interdependence. The government should be more cautious to avoid overreliance and emphasize discipline."

            <p>"Great course with really really interesting materials :))) I also love the professor so much and the lectures are super interesting. A lot of the first stuff you learn is relevant in the first exam, so be prepared. Even though I loved this class, I would like to criticize US-centric strategies. I think that the state should reduce interventions and allow things to take their natural course! As I always say “the more taboos and prohibitions there are in the world, the poorer the people. The more sharp implements the people have, the more benighted the state” (199; LaoZi). From the class I learned that the United States has too much attachment to power and control. Therefore, my main takeaway from this is that the country should go with a broader and less forceful approach that allows global dynamics to unfold naturally. In addition, I just think that neoclassical government models are dumb because they focus too much on active governance and intervention. True leadership follows the Way, it would be cool if the world could just govern itself :0"

            <p>"LOVE. LOVE. I LOVE this class!!! I recommend everyone to take this class with their friends. It sparks so many great and meaningful discussions. Amazing introduction into IR theory and American foreign policy. Also I agree with and relate to a lot of the material that I learned. I really enjoyed the topic of international cooperation because it shows universal love! Organizations such as the United Nations are awesome!!! All countries act in the interest of all humanity rather than self-interest and pursuing power. “If people regarded other people’s state in the same way that they regard their own, who then would incite their own state to attack that of another” (66; Mozi). Therefore, I think we should treat China’s growth impartially with universal love and shared responsibility. I really like the democratic peace theory’s emphasis on stable governance  because it means it is leadership based on merit. Leaders should be chosen for their ability to ensure peace and the well-being of the population."

        <div class="comment">
            <p>"Definitely NOT a gem. DO NOT skim the readings. Kertzer is an amazing lecturer but I did not enjoy the content that much because I do not agree with a lot of the concepts and topics. I personally think that the course's US-centric perspective is quite lame. I personally think that this approach is quite arrogant and self-centered. We should learn about more perspectives and the limitations of fixed identities. Everything is interconnected because “Heaven and earth were born alongside me, and the ten thousand things and I are one” (234, ZhuangZi). Therefore, learning more about others can help us better deal with natural flow and changes of relationships of countries. In addition, I think that international cooperation is dumb and probably very temporary because I doubt the permanence of shared norms. True harmony comes naturally and not by rigid and forced agreements!!! Fixed government models are also quite useless, in my opinion, because they do not take into account the unpredictability and transformative nature of life. The system is too rigid; therefore, we should start making changing :/"

            <p> "Take. this. class. I love Professor Kertzer and the TF. They are all super sweet and ready to help the students whenever they need. The readings are also quite LONG and TEDIOUS so definitely start early or it will trip you up. Even though learning this course was awesome and I got a lot of insight about foreign policy, it was too theoretical. I think the school should prioritize teaching the students military strategy. I also thought it was funny when I learned that the United States supports that moral leadership sustains power. This is quite false and misguided :( In my opinion, a country’s strength comes from law and order, not from appealing to moral values. This is why democratic peace theory is useless because they care too much about public opinion. “There is no greater benefit for the people in the empire than order, and there is no firmer order to be obtained than by making law supreme” (29 “Opening and Debarring”; Lord Shang). I quickly want to address China’s growth. We should just counter threats because international cooperation is weak unless backed by force. Overall, definitely take this class and you will learn a lot!"
