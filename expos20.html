            <p>"I appreciate how we can choose from one of many topics that we’re interested in for EXPOS. In this way,
                I feel like each student is able to naturally nurture their writing. I chose to take Wastelands, which
                encourages thoughtful reflection on the multifaceted characteristics of both literary and real-world
                wastelands. This aligns with my belief that human nature is inherently good; it simply must be nurtured
                with effort. It had SUPER interesting content! I especially enjoyed reading Vinay Gidwani’s theses and
                watching the documentary on Jardim Gramacho in Unit 2. In these pieces, we can see that even in tough
                situations, such as those of the catadores living in slums, humans prevail to be good: “if [their
                sprouts] merely gets nourishment, there is nothing that will not grow,” (151; Mengzi 6A8). The content
                of EXPOS really prompts students to examine how places that seem like wastelands are really brimming
                with life and discussion during class and our final research paper helps us realize this in our lives
                too!" - Mengzi (Mencius) </p>

            <p>"Wastelands reflects many aspects of the Dao, particularly in its encouragement of self-reflection and
                its recognition of the interconnectedness and presence of wastelands in so many facets of life, both
                literary and real. I especially saw this emphasis in Unit 3, where each student researches their own
                topic where there appears to be a wasteland (but not really). I can really see the interconnectedness of
                the wasteland theme across time, place, and human action by studying context, which is truly reflective
                of the Way. However, I felt that the units were not very well-connected with each other. Rather than
                units, I think we could study wastelands in a continuous flow throughout the class, culminating in a
                longer final project/paper rather than having three separate papers on separate topics. Adding onto
                this, I have some doubts about the concept of the EXPOS class, generally. There are many ideas in this
                world, such as the Way, that we simply cannot capture just with words: “Because they [are] beyond
                understanding, only with difficulty can we try to describe them,” (179; Laozi Chapter 15). Still, I
                appreciate the flexibility when choosing the topic of the final research paper, the instructor’s respect
                for learning and being able to hear other students’ voices, all of which reflect the harmony of the Dao."
                - Laozi (Daodejing)</p>

            <p>"It's Expos! so its a little dull and there arent too many moments of meditation or stillness. but
                professor brown is really really nice and helped students center our thoughts before writing or
                discussion, and its a gem. not life changing, but good as far as expos goes–––which is saying a lot,
                considering that prof brown has to make the most of a boring structured requirement course. but each
                time he gave us feedback, i was really able to revise and reflect on my own writing process and
                cultivate internal balance and stay “aligned and be tranquil... with a stable mind at my core,” (60;
                Inward Training VIII). i also felt that we really got to study the nuances in daily life and in the
                larger picture through the context of literary readings and in real-world situations. prof brown really
                encouraged us to view things from so many different perspectives, especially with our “thick
                description” assignment. he really helps us remain present with these types of close-reading exercises
                and contextual research in unit 3." - Inward Training (Neiye)</p>

            <p>"If you have to take EXPOS 20–you probably do :( –take this one!! I really enjoyed how Wastelands
                deconstructs traditional assumptions about wastelands, both in literature and reality. Throughout the
                course, you really get to analyze the nuance of each “wasteland” we study. You really get to see the Dao
                in everything—even desolation. I feel like I was really able to relate my own teachings to how we
                questioned the seemingly fixed boundaries of wastelands. I really enjoyed connecting my own story to our
                discussions about how there is so much more to each “wasteland.”
                “[The turtle] teetered and fell back, and then began to tell of the sea.
                ‘A thousand li wouldn’t measure its breadth. A thousand fathoms wouldn’t plumb its depths. In Yu’s time
                there were floods nine years in ten, but its waters never rose. In Tang’s time there were droughts seven
                years in eight, but its shores never receded. Not to change or shift for an instant or ever, not to
                advance or retreat a little or a lot—that’s the happiness of the eastern sea.’
                When the frog in the caved-in well heard this, he spluttered in surprise and forgot who he
                was. . . .” (260; Zhuangzi Chapter 17)
                I felt that this idea was especially powerful when juxtaposing Vinay Gidwani’s theses with documentaries
                in Unit 2, as we were able to embrace multiple perspectives and challenge conventional ideas about value
                and waste. While I do have my grievances with having to take EXPOS at all—the Dao cannot be constrained
                by rubrics or overly linear processes— the course’s goal of equipping students with tools to combat
                assumptions about wastelands resonates deeply with my view that wisdom lies in seeing beyond
                appearances." - Zhuangzi</p>

        <div class="comment">
            <p>"Unlike a lot of other people, I’m a big fan of EXPOS. I think this course, especially Wastelands,
                exemplifies the harmony of a well-structured education. Professor Brown is simply the best: “Both
                keeping past teachings alive and understanding the present—someone able to do this is worthy of being a
                teacher,” (8; Analects 2.11). Taking Professor Brown’s feedback and using that to improve my writing for
                the next assignment–“To make a mistake and yet to not change your ways—this is what is called truly
                making a mistake” (45, Analects 15.29)–as well as rigorously engaging with texts, reflects the
                discipline required for self-cultivation. Unit 1 is an excellent starting point, teaching students to
                critically engage with cultural narratives of wastelands and fostering a gentlemanly pursuit of wisdom
                through close reading. Unit 2 expands on this by introducing real-world applications, a critical step in
                connecting learning with practical action. The emphasis on collaboration and respectful discussion in
                class participation mirrors the virtues of ritual and propriety, which are central to fostering a
                harmonious learning environment. The inclusion of contemporary issues in Unit 3 reinforces the
                importance of recognizing the patterns of wastelands that we saw in the earlier units and applying it to
                a topic of our own such that we can formulate a thesis on how to break these patterns. I felt that EXPOS
                truly understood the importance of ritual and I was really able to internalize and change my writing for
                the better through repeated reading, revision, and writing. I believe that the true purpose of learning
                is moral and intellectual refinement, so I would caution students against focusing too much on grades or
                outcomes. But, overall, Wastelands was a transformative experience that has had an immense impact on
                both my writing and my emotions and thoughts." - Confucius (Kongzi)

            <p> "If I had to do a cost-benefit analysis of this course, i would say that there is a net benefit.
                wastelands demonstrates a practical application of learning, particularly in its focus on real-world
                wastelands in unit 3. i enjoyed picking my own topic to dissect and researching the political, economic,
                and social factors surrounding it for my thesis on promoting universal love and addressing human
                suffering. i didn’t enjoy unit 1 as much as unit 2; witnessing wastelands in the literary perspective
                doesn’t seem to have as much practical use as studying Gidwani’s theses and the “Waste Land” documentary
                in unit 2 is highly commendable, as it encourages students to critically analyze how value is
                constructed and how waste reflects societal neglect. i also appreciate the focus on teamwork and class
                discussion, which fosters mutual benefit and shared learning. each student is given an opportunity to
                voice their opinion and graded upon the same rubric: impartiality gives rise to all the great benefits
                in the world,” (66; Mozi Chapter Sixteen). i really enjoyed the rigid structure and knowing the
                requirements of each paper. however, i sometimes wish we were given even more of a template to follow; i
                felt that there wasn’t enough direction on the final paper. ultimately, the course was very fair and you
                know what you are getting yourself into." - Mozi
